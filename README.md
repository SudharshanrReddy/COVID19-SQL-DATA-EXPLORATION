# COVID19-SQL-DATA-EXPLORATION 
Overview:
This project dives into the analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL Server. 
Leveraging various SQL techniques such as Views, CTEs, Joins, Aggregate Functions, Window Functions, and Data Type Conversions.
I explored the pandemic's data landscape to uncover trends and insights.

Features:
Utilized Views for simplified querying and analysis of complex data sets.
Employed Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for recursive queries and temporary result sets.
Applied Joins to combine data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.
Utilized Aggregate Functions to summarize data for statistical analysis.
Leveraged Window Functions for advanced analytics and trend analysis.
Conducted Data Type Conversions for data normalization and compatibility.
